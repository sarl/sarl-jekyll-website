**Paper description**
**A New Perspective on Multi-Agent Environment with SARL**

**Abstract:**
The environment is now considered as a first class abstraction in multiagent systems. However, the boundary between real and
simulated environment and the application logic is not so well defined. Depending on applications, the environment as a space
shared between agents may integrate physical, communication or social dimensions where agents interact. In this paper, authors
introduce an agent environment model supporting the intrasic distributed and hierarchical natures of the environment. It is defined
using the fundamental concepts provided by metamodel related to the SARL programming language.
