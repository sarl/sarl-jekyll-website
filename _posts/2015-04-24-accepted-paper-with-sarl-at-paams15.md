**Paper description**
**Contextualize Agent Interactions by Combining Communication and Physical Dimensions in the Environment**

**Abstract:**
The environment, as a space shared between agents, is a key component of multiagent systems (MAS). Depending on systems, this space may integrate physical, communication or communication dimensions.
Each of them has its own process and rules to support agents' interaction.
The dimensions of the environment are generally connected either outside of the agents or within each agent, according to the target application.
In order to ensure a multiagent control, the relations between dimensions must be explicit outside of the agents.
Using these relations between the environment dimensions, the interaction becomes also multi-dimensional.
In this paper, rules and mechanisms to make this connection outside of the agents are formalized.
The model connects the physical and communication dimensions to realize contextualized interactions. It is implemented using the SARL multiagent programming language, and illustrated with an urban traffic simulation.
