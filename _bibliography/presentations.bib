This type of system is able to support the modeling of complex systems in which multiple atomic entities are interacting together in order to reach a common goal. SARL (http://www.sarl.io) is a general-purpose agent-oriented language. It aims at providing the fundamental abstractions for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interaction, decentralization, reactivity, autonomy and dynamic reconfiguration. These high-level features are now considered as the major requirements for an easy and practical implementation of modern complex software applications, and specifically agent-oriented programming. This talk will introduce you to the advances of the SARL agent programming languages, and provides several examples of usages.},
