	abstract = {Low volume traveler flows cause problems for public transportation (PT) providers. The Smart- PT project aims to find out how such flows can be combined to increase the service provider viability. The capability to conceive multi-modal trips is fundamental in that context and is modeled by the Trip Sequence Composer (TSC) concept. A TSC is an essential component of the travelerâ€™s brain, of the customer support operated by collective transport providers, of trip advisers in websites etc. We present a simulation model design to evaluate the effect of cooperating TSCs on the viability of demand responsive collective transport providers. While obeying specific regulations, specialized services targeting mobility impaired people can also serve regular requests in order to save fleet and personnel costs.},

However, the boundary between real and simulated environment and the application logic is not so well defined. Depending on applications, the environment as a space shared between agents may integrate physical, communication or social dimensions where agents interact. In this paper, authors introduce a new view for structuring the notion of environment in a multiagent systems using the fundamental concepts provided by the SARL programming language.},

	abstract = {The environment, as a space shared between agents, is a key component of multiagent systems (MAS). Depending on systems, this space may integrate physical, communication or social dimensions. Each of them has its own process and rules to support agents' interaction. For instance, in the physical dimension, the rules may be based on the agents' location. The agents' interaction is then contextualized and the environment allows a multiagent control since it performs the interactions according to the state and rules of the MAS. The dimensions of the environment are generally connected either in an application dependent adhoc way outside of the agents or within each agent. In order to ensure a multiagent control, the relations between dimensions must be explicit outside of the agents. Using these relations between the environment dimensions, the interaction becomes also multi-dimensional. In this paper we propose to formalize rules and mechanisms to make this connection outside of the agents and in a generic way.},

Selon les syst\`emes, cet espace int\`egre des dimensions diff\'erentes comme une dimension physique support \`a l'ancrage spatial et \`a l'activit\'e des agents sur cette dimension, ou une dimension sociale support aux communications entre agents. Ces dimensions sont souvent trait\'ees de mani\`ere ind\'ependante et ne sont reli\'ees qu'au sein de l'agent qui constitue alors le lieu de jonction et de combinaison des informations v\'ehicul\'ees dans ces diff\'erentes dimensions.

   abstract = {Complex software systems development require appropriate high-level features to better and easily tackle the new requirements in terms of interactions, concurrency and distribution. This requires a paradigm change in software engineering and corresponding programming languages. We are convinced that agent-oriented programming may be the support for this change by focusing on a small corpus of commonly accepted concepts and the corresponding programming language in line with the current developers' programming practices. This papers introduces {SARL}, a new general-purpose agent-oriented programming language undertaking this challenge. {SARL} comes with its full support in the Eclipse {IDE} for compilation and debugging, and a new version 2.0 of the Janus platform for execution purposes. The main perspective that guided the creation of {SARL} is the establishment of an open and easily extensible language. Our expectation is to provide the community with a common forum in terms of a first working testbed to study and compare various programming alternatives and associated metamodels.},
