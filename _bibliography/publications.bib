   abstract = {Complex software systems development require appropriate high-level features to better and easily tackle the new requirements in terms of interactions, concurrency and distribution. This requires a paradigm change in software engineering and corresponding programming languages. We are convinced that agent-oriented programming may be the support for this change by focusing on a small corpus of commonly accepted concepts and the corresponding programming language in line with the current developers' programming practices. This papers introduces {SARL}, a new general-purpose agent-oriented programming language undertaking this challenge. {SARL} comes with its full support in the Eclipse {IDE} for compilation and debugging, and a new version 2.0 of the Janus platform for execution purposes. The main perspective that guided the creation of {SARL} is the establishment of an open and easily extensible language. Our expectation is to provide the community with a common forum in terms of a first working testbed to study and compare various programming alternatives and associated metamodels.}
