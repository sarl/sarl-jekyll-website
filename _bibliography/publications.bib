This performance is influenced by the agent platform modules, and by the hardware and operating system modules, including any virtual machine. The impact of these hardware and operating system modules should be understood and evaluated due to there high impact on the global performances. In this paper, we propose the scoring approach, named SARL Experience Index in order to evaluate these two components. The score is based on CPU, memory and disk sub-scores. We advocate this score may be helpful for the agent platform users for determining quickly the positive or negative impacts of a new deployment platform for an agent framework.},

Most of the multilevel models from the literature have fixed a priori level of details (micro-meso, micro- macro, meso-macro). This paper has two goals: it presents the state of the art related to large scale traffic models, and it gives the main research direction to create a novel multilevel model that support dynamic selection of the level during the simulation. Our proposal is based on an organizational modelling approach and the use of the concept of holon (agent composed of agents).},

The Smart- PT project aims to find out how such flows can be combined to increase the service provider viability. The capability to conceive multi-modal trips is fundamental in that context and is modeled by the Trip Sequence Composer (TSC) concept. A TSC is an essential component of the traveler’s brain, of the customer support operated by collective transport providers, of trip advisers in websites etc. We present a simulation model design to evaluate the effect of cooperating TSCs on the viability of demand responsive collective transport providers. While obeying specific regulations, specialized services targeting mobility impaired people can also serve regular requests in order to save fleet and personnel costs.},

Depending on systems, this space may integrate physical, communication or social dimensions. Each of them has its own process and rules to support agents' interaction. For instance, in the physical dimension, the rules may be based on the agents' location. The agents' interaction is then contextualized and the environment allows a multiagent control since it performs the interactions according to the state and rules of the MAS. The dimensions of the environment are generally connected either in an application dependent adhoc way outside of the agents or within each agent. In order to ensure a multiagent control, the relations between dimensions must be explicit outside of the agents. Using these relations between the environment dimensions, the interaction becomes also multi-dimensional. In this paper we propose to formalize rules and mechanisms to make this connection outside of the agents and in a generic way.},

This requires a paradigm change in software engineering and corresponding programming languages. We are convinced that agent-oriented programming may be the support for this change by focusing on a small corpus of commonly accepted concepts and the corresponding programming language in line with the current developers' programming practices. This papers introduces {SARL}, a new general-purpose agent-oriented programming language undertaking this challenge. {SARL} comes with its full support in the Eclipse {IDE} for compilation and debugging, and a new version 2.0 of the Janus platform for execution purposes. The main perspective that guided the creation of {SARL} is the establishment of an open and easily extensible language. Our expectation is to provide the community with a common forum in terms of a first working testbed to study and compare various programming alternatives and associated metamodels.},
