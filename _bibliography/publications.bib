This language aims at providing the fundamental abstractions for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interac- tion, decentralization, reactivity, autonomy and dynamic reconfig- uration that are usually considered as essential for implementing agent- based applications. Every programming language specifies an execution model. In the case of SARL, this execution model is defined based upon the object-oriented paradigm, e.g. a run-time environment written with Java. Accordingly, and by default, the SARL programs are transformed into their equivalent object- oriented programs. The goal of this paper is the explanation of the mapping between the agent paradigm and the object- oriented paradigm, and the definition of transformations from the SARL constructs to the standard object-oriented constructs. They enable the SARL developer understanding the SARL statements, and the mapping to executable entities. The transformations in this paper could also serve as the basis for creating a compiler ex- tension for targeting any object-oriented programming language.},

Due to operational costs, safety concerns and legal regulations, agent- based simulation frameworks are preferably used to implement models and conduct tests. With the abundance of such frameworks, this paper introduces a methodology to compare the most widely used frameworks. The methodology is based on the ISO software quality model, and uses a weighted sum scoring system to give points to the frameworks understudy. The used criteria in the methodology consider agent- based simulation features and adapt specific features of unmanned aerial transportation. Preliminary comparison results and recommendations are provided and discussed.},

A TSC is an essential component of the traveler’s brain, of the customer support operated by collective transport providers, of trip advisers in websites etc. We present a simulation model design to evaluate the effect of cooperating TSCs on the viability of demand responsive collective transport providers.

Depending on systems, this space may integrate physical, communication or social dimensions. Each of them has its own process and rules to support agents' interaction. For instance, in the physical dimension, the rules may be based on the agents' location. The agents' interaction is then contextualized and the environment allows a multiagent control since it performs the interactions according to the state and rules of the MAS. The dimensions of the environment are generally connected either in an application dependent adhoc way outside of the agents or within each agent. In order to ensure a multiagent control, the relations between dimensions must be explicit outside of the agents. Using these relations between the environment dimensions, the interaction becomes also multi-dimensional.
