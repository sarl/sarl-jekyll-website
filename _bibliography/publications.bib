	abstract = {Generally during the execution of the daily schedule, there is a mismatch between the plan and the reality. Faced with unexpected events, which affect the schedule, individuals need to reschedule their decisions. In such situations, time is an important factor when making a rescheduling decision, as people feel time pressure because of the time threshold. Consequently, the rescheduling decision is made under the individual's own Perceived Time Pressure (PTP). PTP does not only depend on the actual time pressure, but also on the individual's characteristics. The aim of this paper is to establish a model to simulate the individual decision behavior under PTP. Under different levels of PTP, individuals will choose different strategies to take the decision, and there are three decision strategies to consider: optimal, salient and experience.},

With the number of operating drones expected to quickly rise in the next few years comes the need to develop efficient collision avoidance solutions. To ensure the applicability of the collision avoidance solutions, given the limitations of UAVs, they must rely on a reliable source of information, and must be computationally efficient. This paper aims at providing an implementation of the Velocity Obstacle collision avoidance method, based on the information transmitted by the other UAVs. Multi-agent based simulations using the simulation software AirSim and the multi-agent platform SARL are proposed to assess the validity of the proposed solution.},

	abstract = {Cocoa beans are vital for the chocolate industries, with some African countries (Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon) currently having 72% of the worldwide cocoa production. However, cocoa cultivation faces many threats such as diseases and insects. The most damaging insect that attacks cocoa plant in West Africa is the mirid. The previous works on the mirids accentuate their attention on the macroscopic view of the mirids. Considering the complexity of the environment where mirids live, it is difficult to properly understand the mirids’ dynamics without considering the individual behaviors of the mirids population. The representation of the mirids’ dynamics enables the ability to test many use-case scenarios. To this end, Multi-agent Systems are a suitable paradigm to model complex systems bringing out the interactions between individuals and their environment, along with the impact of their behavior. Therefore, we propose in this paper an agent-based model of the mirids’ dynamics in a cocoa farm. To build this model, we rely on the Agent-oriented Software Process for Engineering Complex Systems (ASPECS) process.},

Ces dimensions sont souvent trait\'ees de mani\`ere ind\'ependante et ne sont reli\'ees qu'au sein de l'agent qui constitue alors le lieu de jonction et de combinaison des informations v\'ehicul\'ees dans ces diff\'erentes dimensions. Il s'av\`ere cependant que la combinaison entre ces dimensions est \`a consid\'erer \'egalement en dehors des agents, pour pouvoir par exemple, situer des communications. Dans cet article, nous proposons un mod\`ele unifi\'e supportant la combinaison des dimensions physiques et sociales pour la mise en {\oe}uvre d'interactions contextualis\'ees entre agents. Ce mod\`ele est d\'evelopp\'e avec le langage multiagent {SARL}. Nous illustrons cette proposition par une application de simulation de trafic routier dans la ville de Belfort.},

   abstract = {Complex software systems development require appropriate high-level features to better and easily tackle the new requirements in terms of interactions, concurrency and distribution. This requires a paradigm change in software engineering and corresponding programming languages. We are convinced that agent-oriented programming may be the support for this change by focusing on a small corpus of commonly accepted concepts and the corresponding programming language in line with the current developers' programming practices. This papers introduces {SARL}, a new general-purpose agent-oriented programming language undertaking this challenge. {SARL} comes with its full support in the Eclipse {IDE} for compilation and debugging, and a new version 2.0 of the Janus platform for execution purposes. The main perspective that guided the creation of {SARL} is the establishment of an open and easily extensible language. Our expectation is to provide the community with a common forum in terms of a first working testbed to study and compare various programming alternatives and associated metamodels.},
