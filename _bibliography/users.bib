By aligning the declarative nature of BSPL with agent behaviors and the event-driven architecture of SARL, this approach facilitates the development of flexible, interaction-driven multi-agent systems.

ABSTRACT = {The efficient management of urban parking systems has emerged as a pivotal issue in today’s smart cities, where increasing vehicle populations strain limited parking infrastructure and challenge sustainable urban mobility. Aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the strategic goals of smart city planning, this study presents a sustainability-driven, multiagent simulation-based framework to model, analyze, and optimize smart parking dynamics in congested urban settings. The system architecture integrates ground-level IoT sensors installed in parking spaces, enabling real-time occupancy detection and communication with a centralized system using low-power wide-area communication protocols (LPWAN). This study introduces an intelligent parking guidance mechanism that dynamically directs drivers to the nearest available slots based on location, historical traffic flow, and predicted availability. To manage real-time data flow, the framework incorporates message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocols and edge processing units for low-latency updates. A predictive algorithm, combining spatial data, usage patterns, and time-series forecasting, supports decision-making for future slot allocation and dynamic pricing policies. Field simulations, calibrated with sensor data in a representative high-density urban district, assess system performance under peak and off-peak conditions. A comparative evaluation against traditional first-come-first-served and static parking systems highlights significant gains: average parking search time is reduced by 42%, vehicular congestion near parking zones declines by 35%, and emissions from circling vehicles drop by 27%. The system also improves user satisfaction by enabling mobile app-based reservation and payment options. These findings contribute to broader sustainability goals by supporting efficient land use, reducing environmental impacts, and enhancing urban livability—key dimensions emphasized in sustainable smart city strategies. The proposed framework offers a scalable, interdisciplinary solution for urban planners and policymakers striving to design inclusive, resilient, and environmentally responsible urban mobility systems.},

	abstract={Small batch sizes and individualized products are managed with the concept of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), enabling flexibility through interchangeable constellations, but increases complexity, especially when dealing with dependencies between decentralized subsystems. To increase the resilience and self-healing capabilities, greater automation of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is a key factor. It is a challenge to gather knowledge about faults, as these rarely occur compared to normal behavior. The flexibility in skill-based production systems makes this situation even more difficult. To overcome this challenge, data and knowledge about faults and their context from several Cyber-Physical Production Modules is used, which leads to federated knowledge databases. The knowledge databases are modeled in the Capability-Skill-Service-Fault-Symptom model (CSSFS model). To achieve the goal of high availability, resilience and autonomy of CPPS, automated decision-making for FDD using CSSFS applications is required. Therefore, automatic communication between FDD components is necessary. Therefore, focus of this paper is on the development of a communication scheme, which models participants using Asset Administration Shells and the I4.0 Language to model their interactions to enable automated communication and makes distributed knowledge accessible. To ensure decentralized control of these services, functionalities from several factory levels are encapsulated by Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) that follow a holonic structure.},

For each new version of the holonic agent, introduced because of the agent members obtaining new roles to achieve new goals and adapt to the changing environment, the approach generates a new plan that can solve the new planning problem associated with this new version against which the plans, executed by the holonic agent, become obsolete. To do this, the approach starts by generating sub-plans capable of solving the planning sub-problems associated with the groups of the holonic agent at its different levels. It then recursively links the sub-plans, according to their hierarchical and behavioural dependency, to obtain a global plan. To generate the sub-plans, the approach exploits the behavioural model of the holonic agent's groups, thereby minimising the computation rate imposed by other multi-agent planning methods.

abstract="Modular skill-based production environments provide a high flexibility to fulfil various requirements in manufacturing like the production of individualized products or the selection of alternative production chains in case of unforeseen disturbances. Within these complex and changing production environments, there is a demand for transparency on the energy consumption and related energy costs for production processes, so that these can be considered during planning and monitoring of machine skills. However, the ability to manufacture products by using such flexible production processes leads to various constellations in which it is difficult to identify and map the related energy consumption of production skills. The objective of this paper is to develop a concept that, in the context of a multi-agent distributed production control system, allows energy agents to interact with resource agents to access energy metering data for energy load profiling during the skill execution in production. A special focus is put on how the functions of energy agents can support a methodical creation of energy load profiles on the granular level of skills. The realization and results are presented on a real-world demonstrator of the SmartFactory-KL as part of a skill-based production environment.",

ABSTRACT = {Volatility and uncertainty of today's value chains along with the market's demands for low-batch customized products mandate production systems to become smarter and more resilient, dynamically and even autonomously adapting to both external and internal disturbances. Such resilient behavior can be partially enabled by highly interconnected Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) incorporating advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Multi-agent solutions can provide better planning and control, improving flexibility and responsiveness in production systems. Small modular parts can autonomously take intelligent decisions and react to local events. The main goal of decentralization and interconnectivity is to enable autonomous and cooperative decision-making. Nevertheless, a more efficient orchestration of various AI components and deeper human integration are required. In addition, global behaviors of coalitions of autonomous agents are not easily comprehensible by workers. Furthermore, it is challenging to implement an Industry 4.0 paradigm where a human should be in charge of decision-making and execution. This paper discusses a Multi-Agent System (MAS) where several software agents cooperate with smart workers to enable a dynamic and reconfigurable production paradigm. Asset Administration Shell (AAS) submodels hold smart workers' descriptions in machine-readable format, serving as an integration layer between various system's components. The self-description capability of the AAS supports the system's adaptability and self-configuration. The proposed concept supports the plug-and-produce functionality of the production modules and improves human-machine integration in the shared assembly tasks.

ABSTRACT = {Modular cyber-physical production systems are an important paradigm of Industry 4.0 to react flexibly to changes. The flexibility of those systems is further increased with skill-based engineering and can be used to adapt to customer requirements or to adapt manufacturing to disturbances in supply chains. Further potential for application of these systems can be found in the topic of electrical energy supply, which is also characterized by fluctuations. The relevance of energy-optimized production schedules for manufacturing systems in general becomes more important with the increased use of renewable energies. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to adapt when short-term energy price updates or unforeseen events occur. To address these challenges with an autonomous approach, this contribution focuses on extensive-form games to adapt energy-optimized production schedules in an agent-based manner. The paper presents agent-based modeling to transform and monitor energy-optimized production schedules into game trees to respond to changing energy prices and disturbances in production. The game is setup with a scheduler agent and energy agents who are considered players. The implementation of the mechanism is presented in two use cases, realizing decision making for an energy price update in a simulation example and for unforeseen events in a real-world demonstrator.},

ABSTRACT = {Agent-based computing remains an active field of research with the goal of building (semi-)autonomous software for dynamic ecosystems. Today, this task should be realized using dedicated, specialized frameworks. Over almost 40 years, multiple agent platforms have been developed. While many of them have been “abandoned”, others remain active, and new ones are constantly being released. This contribution presents a historical perspective on the domain and an up-to-date review of the existing agent platforms. It aims to serve as a reference point for anyone interested in developing agent systems. Therefore, the main characteristics of the included agent platforms are summarized, and selected links to projects where they have been used are provided. Furthermore, the described platforms are divided into general-purpose platforms and those targeting specific application domains. The focus of the contribution is on platforms that can be judged as being under active development. Information about “historical platforms” and platforms with an unclear status is included in a dedicated website accompanying this work.},

This paper explores four strategies, ranging from static road signs to advanced inter-vehicular communication, to better warn the drivers and make them adapt their speed depending on the weather. To evaluate the impact of each policy, agent-based simulations are designed and performed. The results show that a dynamic communication about the weather conditions, supported by either an infrastructure-to-vehicle or a vehicle-to-vehicle protocol, can reduce the probability of occurrence of accidents.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, with the emergence of connected objects and cars, road traffic systems become more and more complex and exhibit hierarchical behaviors at several levels of detail. The multilevel modeling approach is generally appropriate to represent traffic from several perspectives.  However, few works have been interested in  multilevel traffic modeling. Moreover, most of the available multilevel models of traffic proposed in the literature are static because they use a set of predefined levels of detail and these representations cannot change during simulation. To tackle these drawbacks, this paper introduces a holonic multilevel and dynamic traffic model for large-scale traffic systems. To this end, the paper proposes a density-based upward holonification model to group similar entities   to structure the holarchy of traffic. Additionally, it proposes a downward holonification model based on the Gaussian distribution   to  break down non-atomic entities. 
Moreover, the paper presents a methodology for the management of the holarchy's dynamics over time allowing the transitions between heterogeneous representations of a traffic system. Furthermore, multilevel indicators based on standard deviation are  proposed to assess the consistency of the simulation results. The experiments are conducted with several simple scenarios on a highway to investigate the trade-off between the simulation accuracy and the availability of computational resources.},

Consequently, the rescheduling decision is made under the individual's own Perceived Time Pressure (PTP). PTP does not only depend on the actual time pressure, but also on the individual's characteristics. The aim of this paper is to establish a model to simulate the individual decision behavior under PTP.

To ensure the applicability of the collision avoidance solutions, given the limitations of UAVs, they must rely on a reliable source of information, and must be computationally efficient. This paper aims at providing an implementation of the Velocity Obstacle collision avoidance method, based on the information transmitted by the other UAVs. Multi-agent based simulations using the simulation software AirSim and the multi-agent platform SARL are proposed to assess the validity of the proposed solution.},

	abstract = {Cocoa beans are vital for the chocolate industries, with some African countries (Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon) currently having 72% of the worldwide cocoa production. However, cocoa cultivation faces many threats such as diseases and insects. The most damaging insect that attacks cocoa plant in West Africa is the mirid. The previous works on the mirids accentuate their attention on the macroscopic view of the mirids. Considering the complexity of the environment where mirids live, it is difficult to properly understand the mirids’ dynamics without considering the individual behaviors of the mirids population. The representation of the mirids’ dynamics enables the ability to test many use-case scenarios. To this end, Multi-agent Systems are a suitable paradigm to model complex systems bringing out the interactions between individuals and their environment, along with the impact of their behavior. Therefore, we propose in this paper an agent-based model of the mirids’ dynamics in a cocoa farm. To build this model, we rely on the Agent-oriented Software Process for Engineering Complex Systems (ASPECS) process.},

Most of the multilevel models from the literature have fixed a priori level of details (micro-meso, micro- macro, meso-macro). This paper has two goals: it presents the state of the art related to large scale traffic models, and it gives the main research direction to create a novel multilevel model that support dynamic selection of the level during the simulation. Our proposal is based on an organizational modelling approach and the use of the concept of holon (agent composed of agents).},

The Smart- PT project aims to find out how such flows can be combined to increase the service provider viability. The capability to conceive multi-modal trips is fundamental in that context and is modeled by the Trip Sequence Composer (TSC) concept. A TSC is an essential component of the traveler’s brain, of the customer support operated by collective transport providers, of trip advisers in websites etc. We present a simulation model design to evaluate the effect of cooperating TSCs on the viability of demand responsive collective transport providers. While obeying specific regulations, specialized services targeting mobility impaired people can also serve regular requests in order to save fleet and personnel costs.},
