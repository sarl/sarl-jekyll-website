Janus is an open-source multi-agent platform fully implemented in Java 1.8. 
Janus enables developers to quickly create web, enterprise and desktop multiagent-based applications. 
It provides a comprehensive set of features to develop, run, display and monitor multiagent-based applications. 
Janus-based applications can be distributed across a network. 
Janus could be used as an agent-oriented platform, an organizational platform, and/or an holonic platform. 
It also natively manages the concept of recursive agents and holons.

Janus platform was initially published during the 2007-2008 period. Since 2014, Janus is fully reimplemented to
support the SARL Agent-Oriented Programming Language.
