# Install SARL Tools

There are two easy ways to get SARL up and running. A pre-configured Eclipse distribution is available which has already all
the necessary plug-ins installed. Alternatively, you can install SARL SDK into your existing Eclipse using the Eclipse update
mechanism.

## 1. Installation Instructions

You must follow the instructions given on the [download](http://www.sarl.io/download/index.html) page for installing the SARL tools.

## 2. What's next?

In the next section, we will learn how to create a SARL project.
