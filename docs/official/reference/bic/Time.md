The built-in capacity `Time` provides tools for obtaining the current time from the run-time platform.

Time definition is application-dependent and platform-dependent. In other words,
the time values replied by this capacity depends on the run-time environment:
it may be the operating system time, or a simulator time.





##1. Get the Current Time

For obtaining the current time, the `getTime` function is provides by the `Time` capacity:

```sarl
def getTime(timeUnit : TimeUnit = null) : double
```



The timeUnit parameter will enable you to specify the unit of the replied
value (hours, seconds, milliseconds, etc.). If it is not provided,
the values will be expressed in seconds.

```sarl
agent A {
	uses Time
	def myaction {
		var ct = getTime
		var ct2 = getTime(null)
		var ct3 = getTime(TimeUnit::HOURS)
	}
}
```



##2. Get the Factor for Mapping to Operating-System Time

For the time replied by the `getTime` function may be not the operating-system time, e.g. a simulation time.
In order to map the time replied by the `getTime` function and the operating-system time, the
`getOSTimeFactor` function replies a factor that could be applied so that:

```sarl
operatingSystemTime = getOSTimeFactor * getTime
```


The provided function is:

```sarl
def getOSTimeFactor : double
```
