The built-in capacity `InnerContextAccess` provides access to the inner context of the agent.
This is a key feature for creating holonic agent implementation.
The context supported by this built-in capacity is the "inner context," illustrated by the
bottom context in the figure above.




##1. Retrieving the Inner Context

For retrieving the inner context of an agent, this built-in capacity provides the following function:

```sarl
def getInnerContext : AgentContext
```



Example:

```sarl
agent A {
	uses InnerContextAccess
	var c : AgentContext
	def myaction {
		c = getInnerContext
	}
}
```



##2. Members of an Agent

For retrieving information on the member agents of the current agent, several functions are
provided by this built-in capacity.
A member agent is an agent that is not the calling agent, and is a member of at least
one space of the inner context.

The first function replies if the calling agent has other agents as members of its inner context:

```sarl
def hasMemberAgent : boolean
```



The second function replies the number of agents that are members of the inner context of the calling agent:

```sarl
def getMemberAgentCount : int
```



The third function replies all the member agents in the inner context:

```sarl
def getMemberAgents : SynchronizedIterable<UUID>
```



Examples:

```sarl
agent A {
	uses InnerContextAccess
	var b : boolean
	var n : int
	var m : SynchronizedIterable<UUID>
	def myaction {
		b = hasMemberAgent
		n = getMemberAgentCount
		m = getMemberAgents
	}
}
```



##3. Testing if an element is related to the inner context

The `InnerContextAccess` provides a collection of utility functions that test if their parameters
are related to the inner context.


| Function                           | Explanation                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isInnerDefaultSpace(Space)`   | tests if the given space is the default space of the inner context.             |
| `isInnerDefaultSpace(SpaceID)` | tests if the default space of the inner context has the given identifier.       |
| `isInnerDefaultSpace(UUID)`    | tests if the default space of the inner context has the given identifier.       |
| `isInInnerDefaultSpace(Event)` | tests if the given event was emitted in the default space of the inner context. |


The following example illustrates the use of the `isInInnerDefaultSpace` function in the guard
of an behavior unit. In this example, the behavior unit is run only if the event
of type `AnEvent` was emitted in the default space of the inner context.

<note>According to the [General Syntax Reference](../GeneralSyntax.html),
the `event.isInnerDefaultSpace` is equivalent to `isInnerDefaultSpace(event)`.</note>

```sarl
on AnEvent [ occurrence.inInnerDefaultSpace ] {
	// Do something with the event when it was emitted in the inner default space
}
```
