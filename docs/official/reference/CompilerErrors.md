# List of the SARL Compiler Errors and Warnings

This page provides the exhaustive list of error and warning messages that may be generated by the SARL compiler.

The "N." column provides a number that could be used in order to make easier your discussions with the SARL developers on the forums.

The column "Message and Description" contains information and details on each issue.
The **message** gives a template of typical message that is given by the compiler.
The **cause** describes the source of the issue, and provides a short explanation of the cause of the issue.
The **solving** provides guidelines to fix the issue when it is possible.

The "Level" column indicates the level of importance for the issue.
It may be:
* "error": the issue makes the compiler failing and stopping. This type of issue can be ignored neither programmatically (see below) nor with the SARL compiler configuration.
* "warning": the issue is an important message that may have implication on the quality of your program. But, it does not stop the compiler. This type of issue can be ignored neither programmatically (see below) nor with the SARL compiler configuration.
* "info": the issue is a simple information message from the compiler. The impact on the quality of your program is low. The compiler is not stopped when an information message is output. This type of issue can be ignored neither programmatically (see below) nor with  the SARL compiler configuration.
* "configurable": the issue has a level (inside "error", "warning", "info", "ignore") that may be configured by the SARL developers himself. A default level is assumed for the case the SARL developers did not specify his preferred level for the issue. It could be ignore both programmatically (see below) and with the SARL compiler configuration.
* "delegated": it is similar to "configurable", except that the configuration management is delegated to the Eclipse Java Development Toolkit (JDT), and its preference pages. In the case of delegated error, the associated JDT issue code is also provided for information.


In the case of an issue with a "configurable" level, you could select yourself the level that should be used by the SARL compiler for the issue.
This configuration may be done into the preferences of the Eclipse SARL IDE or in the configuration of the `sarlc` command-line compiler.
Additionally, you could force the SARL compiler to ignore an issue by attaching the annotation `@SuppressWarnings("code")` to the element that is marked with the issue.
In this annotation, the code corresponds to the content of the "Code" column below.
This code may have a short format (e.g., the one shown in the column), or a long format (e.g., if you move your mouse pointer on the code, you should see the long format of the code into a pop-up window).
The long code is provided by the SARL compiler at the end of the issue messages.
It is preferable to use the short code as argument of `@SuppressWarnings`. Nevertheless, it may be ambiguous with other issue codes
that could be defined outside the SARL compiler itself (e.g. Eclipse, Checkstyle, etc.). In the case of ambiguity, you could use
the long code as argument of `@SuppressWarnings`.



| N. | Message and Description | Level | Code |
| -- | ----------------------- | ----- | ---- |
| 1 | **Message:** Cannot instantiate the abstract type *type-name*<br>**Cause:** This error is generated when you try to create an instance of an abstract class<br>**Solving:** Replace *type-name* by the name of a concrete class | Error | [abstract_class_instantiation](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.abstract_class_instantiation") |
| 2 | **Message:** Cannot directly invoke the abstract method *func-prototype* of the type *name*<br>**Cause:** The function with the given *func-prototype* is defined as non-abstract in the current type, and it is defined as `abstract` into the super-type. You try to call the super-type's method by using `super.function`. But, the super-type's function is `abstract`. Consequently, it cannot be invoked<br>**Solving:** Remove the call to the super-type function | Configurable; Default is: Error | [abstract_method_invocation](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.abstract_method_invocation") |
| 3 | **Message:** Abstract methods do not specify a body<br>**Cause:** You have defined a method within an interface of a capacity with an associated block of code. Since Java 1.8, the default implementation within interfaces (i.e., a block of code that may be considered as the function's implementation if the class implementing the interface is not providing its own code) is introduced. If you are using SARL upon an older Java environment, this error message is generated<br>**Solving:** Remove the code block | Error | [abstract_method_with_body](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.abstract_method_with_body") |
| 4a | **Message:** Ambiguous *feature-call*. The *feature-type* *feature-1* and *feature-2* both match<br>**Cause:** You are calling a feature (method, field, etc.). But, the target feature is ambiguous. Multiple candidates were found within the scope of your call. SARL compiler cannot choose the concrete feature to be called. In order to help you, the SARL compiler provides to you the list of candidates<br>**Solving:** Rewrite your code in order to remove the ambiguity | Error | [ambiguous_feature_call](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.ambiguous_feature_call") |
| 4b | **Message:** Ambiguous *feature-call*. The *feature-type* *list-of-features* and *feature-2* all match<br>**Cause:** You are calling a feature (method, field, etc.). But, the target feature is ambiguous. Multiple candidates were found within the scope of your call. SARL compiler cannot choose the concrete feature to be called. In order to help you, the SARL compiler provides to you the list of candidates<br>**Solving:** Rewrite your code in order to remove the ambiguity | Error | [ambiguous_feature_call](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.ambiguous_feature_call") |
| 5 | **Message:** The anonymous subclass of *type-name* does not implement *list-of-functions*<br>**Cause:** Because anonymous class cannot be abstract, all the abstract functions that are inherited must be implemented into the anonymous class<br>**Solving:** Implement the missed functions | Error | [anonymous_class_missing_members](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.anonymous_class_missing_members") |
| 6 | **Message:** A static field of an anonymous class must be final<br>**Cause:** Because an anonymous class is a class, we can declare `static` fields for sharing data between the difference instances of the anonymous class (that is the usual usage of static fields for regular classes). However, because an anonymous class is attached to its enclosing context, any side-effect applied by the change of the static field's value must be avoided. That's why a static field in an anonymous class must be unmodifiable, i.e., defined with `val` or marked with the `final` modifier<br>**Solving:** Replace `var` keyword by `val`; or add the `static` modifier to the field | Error | [anonymous_class_static_field](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.anonymous_class_static_field") |
| 7 | **Message:** A method of an anonymous class cannot be static<br>**Cause:** Because an anonymous class is not a named type, we cannot refer to its functions with a static notation (that is the name of the type, followed by the name of the function). Consequently, it is forbidden to define a static function into an anonymous class<br>**Solving:** Remove `static` modifier from the function prototype | Error | [anonymous_class_static_method](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.anonymous_class_static_method") |
| 8a | **Message:** Assignment to final field<br>**Cause:** You try to assign a value to a field that is declared as final, e.g., `val myvar` or `final var myvar`. Since the field is declared as final, its value cannot be changed<br>**Solving:** Remove the final modifier on the field; or assign to another not-final field | Error | [assignment_to_final](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.assignment_to_final") |
| 8b | **Message:** Assignment to final parameter<br>**Cause:** You try to assign a value to a parameter. Parameters are always considered as final from the SARL specification. Since the parameter is declared as final, its value cannot be changed<br>**Solving:** Assign to another not-final variable | Error | [assignment_to_final](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.assignment_to_final") |
| 8c | **Message:** Assignment to final variable<br>**Cause:** You try to assign a value to a variable that is declared as final, e.g., `val myvar` or `final var myvar`. Since the variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed<br>**Solving:** Remove the final modifier on the variable; or assign to another not-final variable | Error | [assignment_to_final](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.assignment_to_final") |
| 9 | **Message:** The left-hand side of an assignment must be a variable<br>**Cause:** According to the definition of the assignment operator, the left operand must always be a variable or a field that is not declared as final. When this error message is generated, it means that the left operand is neither a variable nor a field.<br>Please not that the use of the assignment operator may be considered as a call to a "setter" function. In this case, this error message is not generated<br>**Solving:** Replace the left operand with an appropriate variable or field | Error | [assignment_to_no_variable](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.assignment_to_no_variable") |
| 10 | **Message:** A dispatch method's name must not start with an underscore<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. Internally, each block is attached to an hidden function with a name started with an underscore `_` character. In order to avoid any conflict with the internal functions, it is forbidden to start the name of a dispatch function with an underscore character<br>**Solving:** Rename your dispatch function | Error | [case_func_name_starts_with_underscore](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.case_func_name_starts_with_underscore") |
| 11 | **Message:** A dispatch method must not declare any type parameters<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. This error message is generated when a generic type parameter is defined in the dispatch function prototype; that is forbidden<br>**Solving:** Remove generic type declaration | Error | [case_function_with_type_params](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.case_function_with_type_params") |
| 12 | **Message:** A dispatch method must at least have one parameter declared<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. This error message is generated when a dispatch function has no parameter delcared<br>**Solving:** Add a formal parameter | Error | [case_function_without_params](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.case_function_without_params") |
| 13 | **Message:** Recursive constructor invocation<br>**Cause:** You have defined several constructors into your type that are calling other constructors in the type. The sequence of constructor's calls contains a loop; that is forbidden. An example of failing code is:<br><code>class X {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;new (x : int) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this('c')<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;new (x : char) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this(1)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</code><br>**Solving:** Rewrite your code to avoid cyclic calls to the constructors | Error | [circular_constructor_invocation](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.circular_constructor_invocation") |
| 14a | **Message:** Invalid supertype. Expecting a class<br>**Cause:** According to the syntax of SARL, a type (class, agent, skill, etc.) extends another type. This error message indicates to you that the type after `extends` is not a type implemented with a Java class, when it is expected to have one<br>**Solving:** Remove the `extends` statement; or replace the invalid type by the appropriate class | Error | [class_expected](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.class_expected") |
| 14b | **Message:** Superclass must be a class<br>**Cause:** According to the syntax of SARL, a class extends another class. This error message indicates to you that the type after `extends` is not a class<br>**Solving:** Remove the `extends` statement; or replace the invalid type by the appropriate class | Error | [class_expected](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.class_expected") |
| 15 | **Message:** The class *type-name* must be defined abstract because it does not implement *list-of-functions*<br>**Cause:** You have defined abstract functions into *type-name*, or abstract functions are inherited without beeing implemented. In this case, the *type-name* must also be defined as `abstract` because abstract functions can only be defined into an abstract type<br>**Solving:** Add `abstract` modifier to *type-name* | Error | [class_must_be_defined_abstract](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.class_must_be_defined_abstract") |
| 16a | **Message:** The non-abstract method *first-prototype* inherited from *first-type* conflicts with the method *second-prototype* inherited from *second-type*<br>**Cause:** This error message is generated when the current type inherited from two functions from types *first-type* and *second-type*, and there is a conflict between the signatures of these functions | Error | [conflicting_default_methods](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.conflicting_default_methods") |
| 16b | **Message:** The type *type-name* inherits multiple implementations of the method *func-prototype* from *first-type* and *second-type*<br>**Cause:** This error message is generated when the current type with name *type-name* inherited a block of code for the function with the signature *func-prototype*, either from the super-type named *first-type* and the one named *second-type*. It is impossible for the SARL compiler to determine which one of the two blocks of code to be associated to *type-name* | Error | [conflicting_default_methods](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.conflicting_default_methods") |
| 17 | **Message:** Constant condition is always *boolean-constant*<br>**Cause:** The loop, if-then and switch statements may have a boolean condition that is evalued to `true` or `false`. In this case, the statement itself is superfluous. For example, in the case of a while-loop, if the condition is alwaus `true`, the loop will never exit. This issue message notifies you that a potentiel problem is detected because of the evaluation of an expression to `true` or `false` | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [constant_condition](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.constant_condition") |
| 18 | **Message:** Contructors are only permitted within classes<br>**Cause:** You try to define a construction in a type that cannot be mapped to a low-level class, e.g. class, agent, behavior, etc | Error | [constructor_not_permitted](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.constructor_not_permitted") |
| 19a | **Message:** Type parameters are not supported for constructors<br>**Cause:** A constructor cannot have generic type parameters<br>**Solving:** Remove the generic type parameters | Error | [constructor_type_params_not_supported](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.constructor_type_params_not_supported") |
| 19b | **Message:** Unexpected type parameter to a static constructor<br>**Cause:** A static constructor cannot have generic type parameters<br>**Solving:** Remove the generic type parameters | Error | [constructor_type_params_not_supported](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.constructor_type_params_not_supported") |
| 20 | **Message:** *any-message*<br>**Cause:** Sometime, the Java code that is generated by the SARL compiler may contain compilation errors from the Java compiler point of view. This error code enables the SARL validator to forward the errors that were found into the Java code to be automatically attached to the SARL statement that is the source of the failing Java code<br>**Solving:** Contact the SARL development team | Configurable; Default is: Error | [copyJavaProblems](: "org.eclipse.xtext.builder.copyJavaProblems") |
| 21 | **Message:** The 'create'-method *func-name* in type *type-name* must not be abstract<br>**Cause:** Creation method is inspired from the [factory-method design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern). It is forbidden to define this type of method without code<br>**Solving:** Add source code to the creation method | Error | [create_functions_must_not_be_abstract](: "create_functions_must_not_be_abstract") |
| 22 | **Message:** The inheritance hierarchy of '*type-name*' is inconsistent<br>**Cause:** According the inheritance definition, that is common to SARL and the object-oriented programming languages, cyclic into the inheritance hierarchy is totally forbidden | Error | [cyclic_inheritance](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.cyclic_inheritance") |
| 23a | **Message:** The constructor *name* is deprecated<br>**Cause:** The constructor that you are calling is marked as deprecated directly, or one of its enclosing types is marked as deprecated<br>**Solving:** Read the deprecation comment and update your code accordingly<br>**Delegated to:** org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.deprecation | Delegated; Default is: Warning | [deprecated_member_reference](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.deprecated_member_reference") |
| 23b | **Message:** The enum literal *name* is deprecated<br>**Cause:** The enum literal that you are using is marked as deprecated directly, or one of its enclosing types is marked as deprecated<br>**Solving:** Read the deprecation comment and update your code accordingly<br>**Delegated to:** org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.deprecation | Delegated; Default is: Warning | [deprecated_member_reference](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.deprecated_member_reference") |
| 23c | **Message:** The field *name* is deprecated<br>**Cause:** The field that you are accessor is marked as deprecated directly, or one of its enclosing types is marked as deprecated<br>**Solving:** Read the deprecation comment and update your code accordingly<br>**Delegated to:** org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.deprecation | Delegated; Default is: Warning | [deprecated_member_reference](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.deprecated_member_reference") |
| 23d | **Message:** The method *func-prototype* from the type *container-name* is deprecated<br>**Cause:** The method that you are calling is marked as deprecated directly, or one of its enclosing types is marked as deprecated<br>**Solving:** Read the deprecation comment and update your code accordingly<br>**Delegated to:** org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.deprecation | Delegated; Default is: Warning | [deprecated_member_reference](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.deprecated_member_reference") |
| 23e | **Message:** The type *name* is deprecated<br>**Cause:** The type that you are referencing is marked as deprecated directly, or one of its enclosing types is marked as deprecated<br>**Solving:** Read the deprecation comment and update your code accordingly<br>**Delegated to:** org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.deprecation | Delegated; Default is: Warning | [deprecated_member_reference](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.deprecated_member_reference") |
| 24a | **Message:** Discouraged boolean value. The guard is always true<br>**Cause:** It is discouraged to have the constant `true` as condition of an behavior unit's guard. Indeed, a condition that is always evaluated to true makes the test void and time consuming for nothing<br>**Solving:** Remove the guard of the behavior unit | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [discouraged_boolean_expression](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_boolean_expression") |
| 24b | **Message:** Unexpected assertion due to its positive test result<br>**Cause:** It is discouraged to have the constant `true` as condition of the `assert` statement. Indeed, a condition that is always evaluated to true for an assertion test makes this test void and time consuming for nothing<br>**Solving:** Remove the `assert` statement | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [discouraged_boolean_expression](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_boolean_expression") |
| 25 | **Message:** Discouraged capacity definition. A capacity without actions defined inside is not useful since it cannot be called by an agent or a behavior<br>**Cause:** Message is explicit. There no sense to create a capacity without action according to the SARL metamodel<br>**Solving:** Define an action within the capacity; or delete the capacity | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [discouraged_capacity_definition](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_capacity_definition") |
| 26 | **Message:** Invalid action name '*n*'. You must not give to an action a name with reserved characters<br>**Cause:** Several names are discouraged to be used by the SARL compiler. One reason may be because the name is expected to be used as part of the language in future releases. Or, the name is amgiguous. For example, the name "self" is discouraged by the SARL compiler<br>**Solving:** Change the function name | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [discouraged_function_name](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_function_name") |
| 27a | **Message:** Discouraged use of the break keyword inside a basic loop<br>**Cause:** `break` statement enables to stop the execution of a loop step by continuing the execution after the loop itself. However, according the algothimic best practices, it is not recommended to use the `break` statement for stopping a loop. It may denote a poor algorithmic analysis<br>**Solving:** Rewrite the loop code | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [discouraged_loop_breaking_keyword_use](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_loop_breaking_keyword_use") |
| 27b | **Message:** Discouraged use of the continue keyword inside a basic loop<br>**Cause:** `continue` statement enables to stop the execution of a loop step by continuing the execution at the next loop step. However, according the algothimic best practices, it is not recommended to use the `continue` statement for stopping a loop. It may denote a poor algorithmic analysis<br>**Solving:** Rewrite the loop code | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [discouraged_loop_breaking_keyword_use](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_loop_breaking_keyword_use") |
| 28a | **Message:** Possible invalid usage of 'occurrence'. A impure function is detected into the sequence of calls on 'occurrence'. Because a impure function has a possible side effect and side effect is not allowed on 'occurrence', it may cause an unexpected or invalid running behavior. You have to ensure by yourself that the usage of 'occurrence' is valid<br>**Cause:** Message is clear<br>**Solving:** Rewrite your code to avoid the use of the impure function(s) | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [discouraged_occurrence_readonly_use](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_occurrence_readonly_use") |
| 28b | **Message:** Possible invalid usage of 'occurrence. The value of the feature 'occurrence' or one of its component seems to be copied within a local variable. Because side effect is not allowed on 'occurrence', it may cause an unexpected or invalid running behavior. You have to ensure by yourself that the usage of 'occurrence' is valid<br>**Cause:** Message is clear<br>**Solving:** Rewrite your code to avoid the use of the impure function(s) | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [discouraged_occurrence_readonly_use](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_occurrence_readonly_use") |
| 29 | **Message:** Discouraged feature call: *feature*. You should use the dedicated language keyword, or an agent's capacity in place of this feature call<br>**Cause:** This error is generated when a discouraged feature call is detected. The features that outside the best practices are: `System::err`, `System::out`, `System::setErr`, `System::setOut`, `System::console`, `System::inheritedChannel`, `System::exit` (when called from an object-oriented type), with a named starting with "InputOutput" or "Thread". these different features are considered to be too low level to be used into a agent-oriented program<br>**Solving:** Remove the call | Error | [discouraged_reference](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.discouraged_reference") |
| 30 | **Message:** Dispatch methods have arguments with different primitive types<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. You could define more formal parameters than the mandatory one. This issue message is generated when the formal parameters at the same position into the prototypes of a dispatch function have not the same primitive type. It may cause issues, e.g., a loose of information due the automatic boxing of the parameter values<br>**Solving:** Change the primitive types to have the same in all the prototypes | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [dispatch_functions_different_primitive_args](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.dispatch_functions_different_primitive_args") |
| 31 | **Message:** Static and non-static dispatch methods can not be mixed<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. It is forbidden to mix static and not static prototypes for a single dispatch function<br>**Solving:** Make static or non-static all the prototypes of the same dispatch function | Error | [dispatch_functions_mixed_static_and_non_static](: "dispatch_functions_mixed_static_and_non_static") |
| 32 | **Message:** The dispatch method *fct-name* in type *type-name* must not be abstract<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. Because of this definition, it is forbidden to define, implictly or explicitly, a dispatch function as abstract<br>**Solving:** Add block of code for the dispatch function | Error | [dispatch_functions_must_not_be_abstract](: "dispatch_functions_must_not_be_abstract") |
| 33 | **Message:** The dispatch method must not be static because the dispatch methods in the superclass are not static<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. This error message is generated when a dispatch function into the current type is defined as static function; while the dispatch functions defined into the super-type are not defined as static. You cannot mix static and non-static definitions<br>**Solving:** Remove `static` modifier from the prototype of the local dispatch function | Error | [dispatch_functions_non_static_expected](: "dispatch_functions_non_static_expected") |
| 34 | **Message:** The dispatch method must be static because the dispatch methods in the superclass are static<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. This error message is generated when a dispatch function into the current type is not defined as static function; while the dispatch functions defined into the super-type are defined as static. You cannot mix static and non-static definitions<br>**Solving:** Add `static` modifier to the prototype of the local dispatch function | Error | [dispatch_functions_static_expected](: "dispatch_functions_static_expected") |
| 35 | **Message:** All local dispatch methods must have the same visibility<br>**Cause:** A dispatch function is a function to which multiple blocks of code are attached to. Each block of code is invoked according to a specific type of the first formal parameter of the dispatch function. It is forbidden to define the different prototypes for a single dispatch function with different visibilities<br>**Solving:** Use the same function visility for all the prototypes of the same dispatch function | Error | [dispatch_functions_with_different_visibility](: "dispatch_functions_with_different_visibility") |
| 36a | **Message:** Dispatch method has same name and number of parameters as non-dispatch method<br>**Cause:** A conflict is detected between the name of a dispatch function and the name of not-dispatching function. In this case, the SARL compiler is still able to invoke both functions. Nevertheless, it introduces an ambiguity for the caller of the functions that may have a call to the wrong function. This issue message notifies you that you have to take care of this situation, and ensure that the calls to functions are targeted the right function code<br>**Solving:** Rename the dispatch function; or the non-dispatch function | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [dispatch_plain_function_name_clash](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.dispatch_plain_function_name_clash") |
| 36b | **Message:** Non-dispatch method has same name and number of parameters as dispatch method<br>**Cause:** A conflict is detected between the name of a dispatch function and the name of not-dispatching function. In this case, the SARL compiler is still able to invoke both functions. Nevertheless, it introduces an ambiguity for the caller of the functions that may have a call to the wrong function. This issue message notifies you that you have to take care of this situation, and ensure that the calls to functions are targeted the right function code<br>**Solving:** Rename the non-dispatch function; or the dispatch function | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [dispatch_plain_function_name_clash](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.dispatch_plain_function_name_clash") |
| 37 | **Message:** Duplicate case<br>**Cause:** Into a `switch` statement, you have specified multiple times the same `case`, i.e., with the same case expression. Then, it is impossible to branch to a single `case` from the expression evaluated by the `switch` statement. This ambiguous branching is forbidden<br>**Solving:** Remove one of the cases; or merge the two cases into a single case | Error | [duplicate_case](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.duplicate_case") |
| 38a | **Message:** Duplicate extension with same type<br>**Cause:** [Extension on fields](./general/Extension.html) is supported by SARL syntax. This error message is generated when two extensions have the same name. It is forbidden because they generate two hidden fields with the same name<br>**Solving:** Rename one of the extensions | Error | [duplicate_field](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.duplicate_field") |
| 38b | **Message:** Duplicate field *name*<br>**Cause:** It is forbidden to define multiple fields with the same name into the same type. This error message is generated when two fields have the given *name*<br>**Solving:** Rename one of the two fields | Error | [duplicate_field](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.duplicate_field") |
| 39a | **Message:** Duplicate dispatch methods.

| 165 | **Message:** Unqualified super reference is not allowed in interface context<br>**Cause:** You try to use the `super` statement from an interface. Because an interface has no associated instance of object and consequently not super-type instance, you cannot call `super`<br>**Solving:** Remove `super` | Configurable; Default is: Error | [unqualified_super_call](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unqualified_super_call") |
| 166 | **Message:** Dead code. The guard is always false<br>**Cause:** The guard that is specified for a behavior unit is evaluated by the compiler to be always false. In this case, the code of the behavior unit has absolutely no change to be executed. It may denote a problem is the design of the entity in which the behavior unit is defined, e.g. an agent<br>**Solving:** Change the guard condition; or remove the entier behavior unit | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [unreachable_behavior_unit](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_behavior_unit") |
| 167 | **Message:** Unreachable code: The case can never match. It is already handled by a previous condition<br>**Cause:** You have specified a `case` that is already handled by another `case` before. It means that this `case` will never match because the previous one will do<br>**Solving:** Remove `case` | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [unreachable_case](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_case") |
| 168 | **Message:** Unreachable code: The catch block can never match. It is already handled by a previous condition<br>**Cause:** You have specified a `catch` that is already handled by another `catch` before. It means that this `catch` will never match because the previous one will do<br>**Solving:** Remove `catch` | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [unreachable_catch_block](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_catch_block") |
| 169a | **Message:** Dead code: The variable *name* will never be assigned<br>**Cause:** This error message is generated when a line of code cannot be reached in all the case. For example a loop with a `true` condition should never exit from looping. Then, all the statements after the loop becomes unreachable<br>**Solving:** Remove the dead code | Error | [unreachable_code](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_code") |
| 169b | **Message:** Unreachable code<br>**Cause:** This error message is generated when a line of code cannot be reached in all the case. For example a loop with a `true` condition should never exit from looping. Then, all the statements after the loop becomes unreachable<br>**Solving:** Remove the dead code | Error | [unreachable_code](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_code") |
| 169c | **Message:** Unreachable code<br>**Cause:** This error message is generated when a line of code cannot be reached in all the case. For example a loop with a `true` condition should never exit from looping. Then, all the statements after the loop becomes unreachable<br>**Solving:** Remove the dead code | Error | [unreachable_code](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_code") |
| 169d | **Message:** Unreachable code. The last argument expression does not complete normally<br>**Cause:** This error message is generated when the evaluation of the last argument causes a stop of the execution sequence that avoid to call the method/constructor for switch the argument is computed<br>**Solving:** Remove the unreachable code | Error | [unreachable_code](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_code") |
| 169e | **Message:** Unreachable code. The right argument expression does not complete normally<br>**Cause:** This error message is generated when the evaluation of the right argument causes a stop of the execution sequence that avoid to call the operator for switch the argument is computed<br>**Solving:** Remove the unreachable code | Error | [unreachable_code](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_code") |
| 169f | **Message:** Unreachable expression<br>**Cause:** This error message is generated when a line of code cannot be reached in all the case. For example a loop with a `true` condition should never exit from looping. Then, all the statements after the loop becomes unreachable<br>**Solving:** Remove the unreachable code | Error | [unreachable_code](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_code") |
| 170 | **Message:** Unreachable code: The if condition can never match. It is already handled by a previous condition<br>**Cause:** Inside a condition of `if` statement, you have specified multiple tests with `instanceof`. Since all the boolean conditions are evaluated from left to right, an `instanceof` test never matches because a left-most `instanceof` already matches the same scope of types<br>**Solving:** Remove the unmatchable `instanceof` | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [unreachable_instance_of](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unreachable_instance_of") |
| 171a | **Message:** The capacity '*capacity-name*' is not used<br>**Cause:** This issue is generated when *capacity-name* is specified after a `uses` statement, but none of the capacity's functions is invoked from the current entity (agent, etc.)<br>**Solving:** Remove *capacity-name* from the `uses` statement | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [unused_agent_capacity](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.unused_agent_capacity") |
| 171b | **Message:** Unnecessary use of the capacity '*capacity-name*' because it is implemented by the current skill<br>**Cause:** This issue is generated when the capacity named *capacity-name* is specified after a `uses` keyword; and it is at the same time an implemented capacity by the skill in which the `uses` statement is specified. The `uses` specification is redundant, because the functions that are defined into the capacity *capacity-name* are already accessible due to their local implementation<br>**Solving:** Remove *capacity-name* from the `uses` statement | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [unused_agent_capacity](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.unused_agent_capacity") |
| 172 | **Message:** The value of the local variable *name* is not used<br>**Cause:** You have declared a local variable with the given *name*, but never use it somewhere<br>**Solving:** Remove the variable declaration; or Use the variable | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [unused_local_variable](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.unused_local_variable") |
| 173 | **Message:** The method *func-prototype* from the type *type-name* is never used locally<br>**Cause:** This warning is generated because you have defined a private function that is never called. This is not a problem for running your program. But, it makes your binary executable file larger than stricly necessary<br>**Solving:** Remove the private function<br>**Delegated to:** org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unusedPrivateMember | Delegated; Default is: Warning | [unused_private_member](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.unused_private_member") |
| 174 | **Message:** Discouraged use of reserved annotation. @*name* is an annotation that is reserved for the compiler usage<br>**Cause:** SARL core library defines a collection of SARL annotations that are dedicated to the internal usage of the SARL compiler. They are supposed to never be in the SARL code directly. This issue message is generated when one of these SARL annotations is explicitly specified into the code<br>**Solving:** Remove the SARL annotation from your code | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [use_reserved_sarl_annotation](: "io.sarl.lang.validation.IssueCodes.use_reserved_sarl_annotation") |
| 175a | **Message:** '*name*' is a reserved keyword which is not allowed as identifier. Please choose another word<br>**Cause:** You defined the name of a feature by using a *name* that is equal to a SARL keyword. As in all programming languages, it is forbidden to use a language keyword as identifier<br>**Solving:** Change *name* to another identifier that is not a SARL keyword | Error | [used_reserved_keyword](: "io.sarl.lang.parser.SyntaxIssueCodes.used_reserved_keyword") |
| 175b | **Message:** '*name*' is a reserved keyword which is not allowed as identifier. Please choose another word or alternatively confuse your co-workers by escaping it like this: *simple-solution*<br>**Cause:** You defined the name of a feature by using a *name* that is equal to a SARL keyword. As in all programming languages, it is forbidden to use a language keyword as identifier. This error message problem to you a *simple-solution*<br>**Solving:** Apply *name* to *simple-solution* or to another name that is not a SARL keyword | Error | [used_reserved_keyword](: "io.sarl.lang.parser.SyntaxIssueCodes.used_reserved_keyword") |
| 176a | **Message:** '*name*' is not a valid name<br>**Cause:** This is the general error for notifying you that the name of an element is invalid. Most of the time, it is due to the use of a forbidden character into the *name*. The major forbidden character is &#x24;. It is not allowed to use it inside a name, even if it is allowed into the Java specification<br>**Solving:** Rename the element | Error | [variable_name_disallowed](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.variable_name_disallowed") |
| 176b | **Message:** Invalid name '*name*'. You must not give to a field a name with reserved characters<br>**Cause:** You have defined an name for a field that contains forbidden characters. The major forbidden character is &#x24;. It is not allowed to use it inside a name, even if it is allowed into the Java specification<br>**Solving:** Rename your field | Error | [variable_name_disallowed](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.variable_name_disallowed") |
| 176c | **Message:** Invalid name '*name*'. You must not give to an field the same name as a reserved keyword<br>**Cause:** You have defined an name for a field that is equal to a reserved keyword<br>**Solving:** Rename your field | Error | [variable_name_disallowed](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.variable_name_disallowed") |
| 177a | **Message:** '*name*' is a discouraged name<br>**Cause:** This is the general message for notifying you that the name of an element is discouraged. Most of the time, it is due to the fact it may cause ambiguity with SARL language keywords, e.g. `self`<br>**Solving:** Rename the element | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [variable_name_discouraged](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.variable_name_discouraged") |
| 177b | **Message:** 'self' is a discouraged name<br>**Cause:** `self` is a name that is used in several other programming languages as a synonym of `this`. In order to avoid ambiguity, `self` is a discouraged name<br>**Solving:** Rename the element | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [variable_name_discouraged](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.variable_name_discouraged") |
| 178a | **Message:** Duplicate local variable *name*<br>**Cause:** You have declared two different variables in the same scope but with exactly the same name. It is simply forbidden to hide local variables<br>**Solving:** Rename one of the local variables | Error | [variable_name_shadowing](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.variable_name_shadowing") |
| 178b | **Message:** The field '*field-name*' in '*type-name*' is hidding the inherited field '*super-field-name*'<br>**Cause:** You have declared a field with the name *field-name* into the current type; but an accessible field with the same name is also declared into a super-type. It means that the value of the field into the super-type will not be accessible directly from the current type<br>**Solving:** Rename field *field-name* | Configurable; Default is: Warning | [variable_name_shadowing](: "org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.validation.IssueCodes.variable_name_shadowing") |
| 179 | **Message:** The type *type-name* cannot extend or implement *other-type*. A supertype may not specify any wildcard<br>**Cause:** The super-type named *other-type* is defined with wildcard into its generic type parameters. It is forbidden to extends or implement a super-type with a wildcard | Error | [wildcard_in_supertype](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.wildcard_in_supertype") |
| 180a | **Message:** The annotation @*name* is disallowed for this location<br>**Cause:** An annotation is defined in order to be attached to a specific type of element (type, field, method, etc.). This error is generated when an annotation with the given *name* is attached to a wrong type of element | Error | [wrong_annotation_target](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.wrong_annotation_target") |
| 180b | **Message:** Unexpected annotation to a static constructor<br>**Cause:** A static constructor cannot have an annotation attached to it. This issue message is generated when a static constructor is annotated | Error | [wrong_annotation_target](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.wrong_annotation_target") |
| 181a | **Message:** The declared package '*actual-name*' does not match the expected package '*expected-name*'<br>**Cause:** SARL enables to create groups of types that are named packages in order to increase the modularity of your software. The different types are written into SARL files that are located in folders. Usually the name of the package reflects the structure of the underlying folders, i.e., the sequence of folders' names corresponds to the sequence of package name's atoms. In the Java language this mapping is mandatory. In SARL language, this mapping is optional, but considered as a good practice. The SARL compiler notifies you that the *expected-name* may be preferred to the *actual-name*<br>**Solving:** Replace *actual-name* by *expected-name* | Warning | [wrong_package](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.wrong_package") |
| 181b | **Message:** Unexpecting package definition<br>**Cause:** SARL enables to create groups of types that are named packages in order to increase the modularity of your software. The different types are written into SARL files that are located in folders. Usually the name of the package reflects the structure of the underlying folders, i.e., the sequence of folders' names corresponds to the sequence of package name's atoms. In the Java language this mapping is mandatory. In SARL language, this mapping is optional, but considered as a good practice. The SARL compiler notifies you that no name is expected for the package<br>**Solving:** Remove the package definition | Warning | [wrong_package](: "org.eclipse.xtend.core.validation.IssueCodes.wrong_package") |
