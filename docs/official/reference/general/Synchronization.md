# Synchronization Expression

The synchonization expression does the same as it does in Java (see
[Java Language Specification](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.19)).
The only difference is that in SARL it is an expression and can therefore be used at more places. 


##1. Standard Syntax

The synchronization statement can be used as in Java:

```sarl
var lock = new Object
synchronized (lock) {
	println("Hello")
}
```



##2. Expression Syntax

Because the `synchronized` keyword is an expression, it is possible to write synchronized code inside another expression.

```sarl
var lock = new Object
val name = synchronized (lock) { 
		"Hello" 
}
println(name)
```
