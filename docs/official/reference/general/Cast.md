# Typecasting

Typecasting is an explicit type conversion, also known as type coercion, is a type conversion by the compiler.

##1. Syntax

The typecasting of an expression to a specific type must be done with the `as` keyword. This keywords must
be typed after the expression and before the casting type.

```sarl
something as Integer
56 as Integer
```


In the first example, the `something` expression is casted to `Integer`.
In the second example, the `56` expression is casted to `Integer` too.
