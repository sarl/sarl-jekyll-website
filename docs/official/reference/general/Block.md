# Block Expressions

The block expression consists of a sequence of
expressions. 


##1. General Syntax

A block expression is surrounded by curly braces. The expressions in a block can be terminated
by an optional semicolon.

	{
		<sequence of expressions>
	}

##2. Type and Value of a Block Expression

The value of the last expression in the block is returned as the value of the
complete block.

The type of a block is the returned type (i.e., of the last expression). Empty blocks return
`null` and have the type `Object`.

In the following example, the block type is `String` because the last expressions in all the
possible execution paths are all of type `String`.

```sarl
{
	var x = greeting
	if (x == "Hello") {
		x + " World!" 
	} else {
		x
	}
}
```
