SARL supports a collection of operators. Most of them are infix operators, and several are postfix operators.


##1. Assignments

The assignment operators are listed below. Local variables and fields can be assigned using the `=` operator.
Compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`) can be used as a shorthand for the assignment
of a binary expression. They work automatically when the corresponding infix operator is declared.


| Operator | Operator Semantic                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| a = b    | Set the variable a with the value of b. |
| a += b   | Alias to: `a = a + b`                   |
| a -= b   | Alias to: `a = a - b`                   |
| a *= b   | Alias to: `a = a * b`                   |
| a /= b   | Alias to: `a = a / b`                   |
| a %= b   | Alias to: `a = a % b`                   |


<note>The assignment operator is the only one operator that cannot be overridden yet.
See the [operator overloading section](#operator_overloading) for details.</note>


##2. Arithmetic operators

The arithmetic operators are listed below and take numbers as operands. 
There are either unary (one operand) or binary (two operands).


| Operator | Function Name        | Operator Semantic                                            |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| a + b    | operator\_plus       | Add a and b.                                                 |
| a - b    | operator\_minus      | Subtract b to a. Binary operator.                            |
| a * b    | operator\_multiply   | Multiply a by b.                                             |
| a / b    | operator\_divide     | Divide a by b.                                               |
| a % b    | operator\_modulo     | Modulo of the division of a by b.                            |
| a \*\* b | operator\_power      | Compute the power b of a.                                    |
| - a      | operator\_minus      | Negate the value of a. Unary operator.                       |
| a ++     | operator\_plusPlus   | Increment a by 1, reply the value before the incrementation. |
| a --     | operator\_moinsMoins | Decrement a by 1, reply the value before the decrementation. |


Each operator has an associated function name. This function contains
the concrete implementation of the operational semantic of the
operator. This function can be redefined as explained in the 
[operator overloading section](#operator_overloading).

[operator overloading section](#operator_overloading).


##7. Number Range operators

This section presents a collection of operators that define ranges of values.


| Operator   | Function Name                  | Operator Semantic                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a .. b     | operator\_upTo                 | Create a list of integer values from a (inclusive) to b (inclusive). `1..5` is the range from 1 to 5 with 1 &lt;= x &lt;= 5.  `5..1` is the range from 5 to 1 with 5 &gt;= x &gt;= 1.  The type of this expression is `IntegerRange`. |

##8. Collection Operators

The collection operators are listed below. These operators are dedicated to the collections (lists, sets, maps...)
Most of the time, the first operand is the collection on which the operator must be applied.


| Operator              | Function Name      | Operator Semantic                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| c += e    | operator\_add      | Equivalent to: `c.add(e)`                                                                  |
| c -= e                | operator\_remove   | Equivalent to: `c.remove(e)`                                                               |
| c1 + c2 | operator\_plus     | Create a collection that is containing the elements of the collections `c1` and `c2`.  |
| m + p     | operator\_plus     | Create a map of type `Map<A,B>` that is containing the elements of the map `m` and the new pair `p` of type `Pair<A,B>`.                                                |
| m - p                 | operator\_moins    | Create a map of type `Map<A,B>` that is containing the elements of the map `m`, except the pair `p` of type `Pair<A,B>`.                                                        |
| a -&gt; b             | operator\_mappedTo | Create an instance of `Pair<A,B>` where `A` and `B` are the types of a and b respectively. |












Each operator has an associated function name. This function contains
the concrete implementation of the operational semantic of the
operator. This function can be redefined as explained in the 
[operator overloading section](#operator_overloading).


##9. Other operators

This section presents a collection of operators that are not related to the categories in the previous sections.


| Operator               | Function Name         | Operator Semantic                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a ?: b                 | operator\_elvis       | If a is not null then a else b.                                                   |
| a =&gt; b    | operator\_doubleArrow | Used as a  'with'- or 'let'-operation. It allows you to bind an object to a local scope in order to do something on it. b must be a lambda expression.              |
| a &lt;&gt; b           | operator\_diamond     | Not yet supported.                                                                |






Each operator has an associated function name. This function contains
the concrete implementation of the operational semantic of the
operator. This function can be redefined as explained in the 
[operator overloading section](#operator_overloading).

For an example of the `=&gt;` operator, consider the class `Person` with two attributes inside: `firstName` and `lastName`.
The creation of an instance of `Person` could be done with:

```sarl
new Person => [
	firstName = 'Han';
	lastName = 'Solo'
]
```


<note>Note how the `;` allows two expressions on one line</note>

In this example, the instance of Person is created and passed to the
lambda expression. Inside this expression, the new Person instance is accessible with the `it`
reserved pseudo-variable, which does not need to be typed out since it is the default object in
lambda expression. The lambda expression replies the value of `it`.


##10. Operator Overloading

In SARL, it is easy to overload or re-define an existing operator.

You should define the operator mapping function (see the previous sections for a comprehensive list of them).

 the following example, the addition operator [:plusop] for two `Pair` objects is defined.
 The function that is defining the operator must be named with the `operator_` prefix, and have one parameter
 for each operand associated with the operator. In the example, the addition of two pairs `1 -> 3` and `4 -> 5`.
 gives the pair (a,d).
 
```sarl
def operator_plus(
			a : Pair<Integer,Integer>,
			b : Pair<Integer,Integer>) : Pair<Integer,Integer> {
	return new Pair(a.key, b.value)
}
def example {
	var x = 1 -> 3
	var y = 4 -> 5
	
	// Old-fashion-style call to the overloaded operator
	var z1 = operator_plus(x, y)
	
	// Operator-style call to the overloaded operator
	var z2 = x + y 
	
	// z1 == (1 -> 5)
	println(z1.toString)
	
	// z2 == (1 -> 5)
	println(z2.toString)
}
```
