SARL provides four types of loop statements.


##1. For-Each Loop

The for loop is used to execute a certain expression for each element of an array or an instance of `Iterable`.

The for's variable is local and final, hence cannot be updated.

The type of a for loop is `void`. The type of the local variable can be inferred from the
iterable or array that is processed, e.g. in the following example `v` is of type `String`.

```sarl
var tab : String[]
for (v : tab) {
	println(v)
}
```


You could specify the expected type for the local variable with the `as` following the local variable:

```sarl
for (v as String : tab) {
	println(v)
}
```



##2. Traditional Java For Loop

The traditional for loop is very similar to the one known from Java, or even C.
When executed, it first executes the init-expression, where local variables can be
declared. Next the predicate is executed and if it evaluates to `true`, the
body-expression is executed. On any subsequent iterations the update-expression
is executed instead of the init-expression. This happens until the predicate
returns `false`. The type of a for loop is `void`.

```sarl
for (var i = 0; i<123; i++) {
	println(i)
}
```



##3. While Loop

A while loop is used to execute a certain expression unless the predicate is evaluated to
`false`. The type of a while loop is `void`.

```sarl
var i = 0
while (i<123) {
	println(i)
	i++
}
```



##4. Do-While Loop

A while loop is used to execute a certain expression unless the predicate is evaluated 
to `false`. The difference to the while loop is that the execution starts by 
executing the block once before evaluating the predicate for the first time. 
The type of a while loop is `void`.

```sarl
var i = 0
do {
	println(i)
	i++
}
while (i<123)
```



##5. Breaking a loop

The `break` keyword is provides for breaking the enclosing loop.
When this keyword is run, the control flow exists for the nearest
enclosing loop, and run the statement that is jsut following the loop
expression in the sequence of instructions.

```sarl
for (v : tab) {
	if (v == 1) {
		break
	}
}
```
