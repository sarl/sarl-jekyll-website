##1. General Syntax

###1.1. Can I use the same syntax as in Java for number literals?

__No__.

When a decimal point is written in the literal,
the fractional part and the mantissa part must
be specify also, even if these parts are equal
to zero.  Consequently:

* `123.0` is correct;
* `0.123` is incorrect;
* `123.` is correct;
* `.123` is incorrect.







###1.2. Why can I not put a string in the package name?

It is not allowed to put a SARL keyword, such as
`agent`, in the name of a package.

But, if you prefix with the `^` character the string
that corresponds to a keyword, then it is possible
to obtain a package name with one of its components
equals to a SARL keyword:




###1.3. Is the 'val' keyword defining a constant?

__Yes and No__.

Indeed, the `val` keyword defines a name that it could be initialized only once time.
It is similar to the `final` modifier of the Java language.

Consider the example below: two values are defined, `a` and `b`.
The `a` variable is a real constant because it has a raw type and it is initialized.
The `b` variable is not a real constant because it is a reference to an object.
The reference is constant, *but* the referred object is not. Consequently, it is still
possible to call the setters of `b`. 

```sarl
val a : int = 4
val b : Object = new Object
```



###1.4. Why cannot use the syntax 'a[0]' for arrays?

In SARL, the array type may be written with the classic array syntax, such as
`int[]`, or the object-oriented syntax, such as `List<Integer>`.

SARL considers that the each array is a list of something.
Consequently, retrieving the values of the array must be done with `get(int)`.

```sarl
var a : Integer[] = #[1, 2, 3]
var b : List<Integer> = newArrayList(1, 2, 3)

a.get(0) == b.get(0)
```



###1.5. Why can I not use the '<>' notation for generic parameters?

In SARL, the empty generic parameter list, written `<>` is
not supported: a generic type expression must be written between them.



For solving this problem, two choices: i) add a type expression between
< and >; ii) remove the generic parameter list.

```sarl
var firstSolution : List<Integer> = new ArrayList<Integer>
var secondSolution : List<Integer> = new ArrayList
```



###1.6. How can I create instances of anonymous classes?

In SARL, the creation of anonymous classes (interface implementation...)
must be done with a closure.

Consider the definition of the following interface:

```sarl
interface MyInterface {
     def myfunction(parameter : Object) : void
}
```


The on-the-fly definition and instantiation of an instance of this interface,
a.k.a. anonymous class definition in the Java community, could be written is SARL
with the following closure:

```sarl
var instance : MyInterface
instance = [ parameter | /* The code of myfunction() */ ]
```



###1.7. Java syntax for anonymous classes is allowed

In SARL, it is recommended tp create anonymous classes (interface implementation...)
must be done with a closure (see previous question).

The Java-based syntax for defining an anonymous class's instance is allowed, but not recommended
in the SARL language. It means that the following code is valid:

```sarl
var instance = new MyInterface() {
	def myfunction(parameter : Object) {
		/* The code of myfunction() */
	}
}
```



###1.8. Ambiguous call to capacity function

When the calling a capacity function, the SARL compiler complains with an "ambiguous call" error.
In the code below, the function `myfunction` is defined in the capacities `C1` and `C2`.
The call to `myfunction` in the agent definition is the place where the error occurs.

```sarl
capacity C1 {
	def myfunction
	def myfunction2
}
capacity C2 {
	def myfunction
	def myfunction3
}
agent MyAgent {
	uses C1, C2
	on Initialize {
	    myfunction
	    myfunction2
	    myfunction3
	}
}
```


This error is standard because the functions of the capacities `C1` and `C2` are implicitly accessible
in the scope of the agent definition, see `uses` keyword definition. The SARL compiler is then unable
to determine that is the function to call.


For solving this issue, the developer must explicitly call the correct version of `myfunction` by
getting the capacity. The following code is the correct call to the function if the function in the
capacity `C1` should be called:

```sarl
getSkill(C1).myfunction
```
