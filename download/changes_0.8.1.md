# Changes in 0.8.1

Release date: 2018-09-28.

## 1. Janus Run-time Environment

* When a event is self fired from the `on Initialize`, it may be never received by the agent. This patch fixes this issue that is due to the missed firing of the buffered events. ([details](http://github.com/sarl/sarl/commit/7c41f3c0e0788ddefa5a1ee2f2835549e0dcf590))

## 2 General Changes
